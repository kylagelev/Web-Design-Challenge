<h1 class=header1 id=landing_page_header>Take a look at what the <strong>Weather</strong> is going on!</h1>

<p> 
  Drawing from an active weather API, a collection of 500 random cities has been compiled and analyzed to produce visualizations of certain weather conditions and the location (latitude) of these cities. 
  These weather conditions include: general temperature (in Fahrenheit), humidity, cloudiness, and windspeed. 
  Each respective city's latitude was plotted on the x-axis as the independent variable, while these weather conditions were plotted on the y-axis, the dependent variable.
  The relationship between each condition and latitude was then analyzed.
  Following a series of general plots for each weather condition and all latitudes, a series of plots were created using latitudes from the Northern and Southern Hemisphere, individually.
  These were imperative in order to better analyze whether location has a correlation to these weather aspects.
  Analysis is included for each graph on their respective page.
