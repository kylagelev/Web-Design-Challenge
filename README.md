# Web-Design-Challenge

Using data from a previous repository, a series of html pages have been made that are interconnected via multiple means, including a sidebar and navigation bar, allowing access to them. There are seven total html pages: an index.html (the landing page), four visualization pages, a comparison page, and a data page. The pages are also capable of resizing based upon media.
